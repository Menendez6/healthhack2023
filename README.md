2. make sure you put all the two files and python together.<br>
3.run the python file(maze.py).<br></font>

## Updates 
 I am a kid so I dont have that much time to update the game.
 
 I'll try to update monthly or weekly.
 
 For this 0.01 version I created a maze and a character that you can control with The four direction keys.In later version I'll create enemy and more traps. I got this from a Youtube video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUNibx2gxc&t=27s">Click here to See how that person make the game!!! </a>
